- CLI Todo List
Start in Python.
Afterwards: C, C++, Go, Rust, Zig
Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OPLE0cF8JU

What does todo list need to have?
- make tasks
- delete tasks
- see tasks
- sort by date
- date parsing
- remove view, auto view on edit
- search for task (to delete)
- delete item

to do:
- fix oversight: date is no longer required, what happens if you delete proj3 if 2 * (proj3, None, None)??
- add exit
- add saving to files
